## Name
Curator

A swirl of letters floats about in an orb-like shape with a white light at its center. Words occasionally form as half-spoken ideas and thoughts before twisting and spinning back into the center of the mass. Seemingly ignoring you, the mass of letters examines a bookshelf, drawing one book away and flipping through its pages with words of consternation forming on the outside – ‘mislaid,’ ‘unwise,’ ‘improper.’ It cautiously removes another book from a shelf with it and moves it reverently – ‘faithful,’ ‘expectation,’ ‘moral’ – to another bookshelf across the room.

Eventually, the mass takes note of you, wafting closer. Once it is near, letters appear in a professional font, presented in the air before it: ‘Greetings. I am the Curator. What do you seek in this sanctum?’

## Backstory summary
An alien presence, the curator simply became a known factor in the Ivory Tower, tending to it and claiming it as its domain. Its motives for being here are unknown, but it is considered non-hostile to any outside. Governors have attempted to remove it to no avail with assailing individuals often removed or captured in a fashion common to their genre – trapped inside books, tricked into teleporting away, calls or correspondence from loved ones – until arrangements are made to end conflict.

## Importance to Player
As curator, it provides information but is unwilling to tip the scales in any fashion other than to return events and circumstances to balance – easy or uneasy.
